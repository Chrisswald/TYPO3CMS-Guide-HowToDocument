You will find information about how to format the documenation 
in reST and some best practices in this guide.

  <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/TYPO3-Documentation/t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs/Index.html>`__ 
  to find out about the visual appearance of various kind of markup.

  about how to write documentation for your extension.
