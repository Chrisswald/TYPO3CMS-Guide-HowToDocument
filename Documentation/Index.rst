:Writing here:    TYPO3 Documentation Team & community
:Status:          Fully revised (July, 2018)


**About this manual**

   This manual is about writing TYPO3 documentation
   (`docs.typo3.org <https://docs.typo3.org>`__). It contains information for
   how to format in :ref:`reST and sphinx <Formatting-with-reST>`. You can find out,
   how to :ref:`contribute to the documentation <docs-contribute>` and
   :ref:`write extension documentation from scratch <how-to-start-documentation-for-ext>`.

**Getting started**

   This manual walks you through how to write documentation. You can read
   it cover-to-cover, beginning with the basics like :ref:`basic-principles`,
   moving on to learning the basic reStructuredText syntax and once you
   have mastered this, beginning with a task like :ref:`Writing documentation
   for an extension <writing-doc-for-ext-start>`.

   But often, you would like to jump right in, start with a specific task
   and learn as you go along.

   In that case, find your task here and start reading:

   * :ref:`writing-doc-for-ext-from-scratch` if you have an extension and would
     like to write documentation for it
   * :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` if you would like to contribute to
     the official documentation and need an easy introduction to editing
     documentation directly on GitHub. This does not require any development
     tools, you just need a browser and a GitHub account.
   * :ref:`docs-contribute-git-docker` if you would like to contribute to
     the official documentation and are already familiar with Git and Docker
   * :ref:`reStructuredText & Sphinx Introduction <writing-rest-introduction>` gives an introduction to the syntax
     of reStructuredText and Sphinx, which is used to write documentation
     files
   * :ref:`rendering-docs` if you would like to start with rendering the
     documentation locally with docker.
