How to Read This Guide
======================

This manual introduces you to writing TYPO3 documentation. You can read
it cover-to-cover.

But often, you would like to **jump right in**, start with a specific task
and learn as you go along. In that case, pick a task in the list below.

.. tip::

   Before you start, we recommend that you read :ref:`basic-principles` to
   familiarize yourself with the structure and
   :ref:`reStructuredText & Sphinx Introduction <writing-rest-introduction>`.
   Additionally, keep the :ref:`rest-cheat-sheet` handy to look up the syntax.


Find your task here and start reading:

* :ref:`writing-doc-for-ext-from-scratch` if you have an extension and would
  like to write documentation for it
* :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` if you would like to contribute to
  the official documentation and need an easy introduction to editing
  documentation directly on GitHub. This does not require any development
  tools, you just need a browser and a GitHub account.
* :ref:`docs-contribute-git-docker` if you would like to contribute to
  the official documentation and are already familiar with Git and Docker
* :ref:`rendering-docs` if you would like to start with rendering the
  documentation locally with Docker.

This document was originally written by Martin Bless.

Further chapters like
:ref:`rest-common-pitfalls`, :ref:`rest-cheat-sheet`, :ref:`docs-contribute`,
:ref:`basic-principles`, :ref:`writing-doc-for-ext-start` and :ref:`docs-official-how-you-can-help`
were added by Sybille Peters.

A number of other people have helped by reviewing and refining the text
and pointing out missing information. For more contributors, see the
`list of contributors on GitHub for this manual <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/graphs/contributors>`__.

We thank everyone for their help and hope that good documentation
about writing documentation will make it easier for others to contribute.
