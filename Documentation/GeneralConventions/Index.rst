General Conventions and Coding Guidelines
=========================================

Here, we are assuming that we are documenting using reST files. While
markdown (.md) is also supported, using reST is recommended for various
reasons.

It is **strongly recommended** to do it the way it is described here.
For alternatives, please look at :ref:`supported-filenames-and-formats`.

In general, the documentation follows the conventions as described in the
following sections.
