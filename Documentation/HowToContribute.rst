   If you plan to make extensive changes, please let us know in the
   **#typo3-documentation** channel on :ref:`Slack <slack>` about it.
   Someone may already be working on the same thing.

Fix Issues
==========

Look at the list of `open and unassigned issues on Github
<https://github.com/search?q=org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+type%3Aissue+state%3Aopen+no%3Aassignee&type=Issues>`__,
pick one and fix it.

Replace outdated images

Replace outdated images, for example in the :ref:`t3tsconfig:start` reference.

Look at :ref:`how-to-document-images` for information about how to use images.

Add YouTube videos
==================


Add some new YouTube videos from the  `TYPO3 YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpl8LY9Tr3PB26Kk2FYW_w>`__.

See :ref:`youtube-videos` for information how to do this.

Review manuals
==============

Pick a manual and review it. If you find something that needs fixing
or something is missing, either fix it or write an
issue for it, if you cannot make the changes yourself.

To find the issues for a manual click on "Related links" (usually on the
bottom left).
