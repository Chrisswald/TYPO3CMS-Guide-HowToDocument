=================================
Contribute with the Github method
=================================

Basic considerations
====================

As mentioned on :ref:`docs-contribute` you can contribute to the
documentation by editing directly on Github. This can be used for
minor changes.

If you wish to make extensive changes or use sphinx specific markup
(.e.g. intersphinx linking) it is recommended to use the :ref:`git/docker
<docs-contribute-git-docker>` method because via local rendering with
docker, you will get the best results. The docker container uses the
same toolchain as on the documentation server.

With the Github Preview, you will not see how the menu is rendered,
you will not see some specific markup in action and it will not show
errors correctly.

That being said, we recommend to try out the method, because it is
a way to quickly make changes, but use the git/docker method in the
long run.
