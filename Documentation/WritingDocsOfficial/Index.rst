======================================
Contributing to official documentation
======================================

The community is welcome to make changes to the documentation.

If you need help, contact us in the **Slack** channel
**#typo3-documentation**. If you do not yet have a Slack account,
see :ref:`slack` for more information.

This chapter explains how to make changes to the official
documentation on `docs.typo3.org <https://docs.typo3.org>`__.

**Getting started**

.. tipp::

   You can start with very minimal knowlege and learn as
   you go along. If you find a page that needs fixing, do not
   hesitate to click on the "Edit me on Github" button and 
   proceed. 
   
Remember, your changes will not be visible right away, someone
must merge them. So don't worry about breaking something!

Just go ahead and start editing away. 

**Suggested reading order:**

Here is a suggestion how to
proceed (but depending on your experience and how you prefer to
work, you may want to just start right away, read in a
different order or skip some sections and come back here later).
That is all ok and up to you!

#. Get an introduction by looking a the :ref:`github-method-youtube`
#. Choose which workflow to use: :ref:`docs-official-workflow-methods`.
#. Do you already know what you want to do? If not, get inspiration:
   :ref:`docs-official-how-you-can-help`
#. To get a better understanding of the documentation and the conventions
   used, it can't hurt to look at :ref:`basic-principles`
#. Familiarize yourself with the language (reST and sphinx) by looking
   at the source of existing docs, reading
   :ref:`general-conventions` and the beginning of
   :ref:`Formatting-with-reST`.
#. Make your changes. Start small.



**Note about other documentation:**

Please note that some of the rendered documentation is
maintained elsewhere (e.g. Core Changelog, 3rdparty extension). This chapter focuses on
making changes to the major manuals, maintained on `Github: TYPO3
Documentation <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation>`__, such
as:

* The `Tutorials and Guides <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/GuidesAndTutorials/Index.html>`__,
* The `Core documenation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/References/Index.html>`_
  (except for Changelog)_

Manuals, not maintained in the TYPO3-Documentation workspace on Github
must be edited elsewhere, see :ref:`overview-of-types`.
