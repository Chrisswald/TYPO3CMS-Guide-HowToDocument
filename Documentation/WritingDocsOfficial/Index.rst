==============================
Writing official documentation
==============================

The community is welcome to make changes to the documentation.

Your help is very much appreciated - even small changes are a big
help.

There is more than one way to do make changes to the
documentation. Using *git* in combination with *docker* is the
**recommended and fully supported** way. We will also list
the other method briefly.


.. rst-class:: bignums

   1. (recommended) *git* / *docker* method

      If you are familiar with git, docker and the command line,
      you can go straight to :ref:`docs-contribute-quickstart` to
      get started.

      If not, you can either use the Github method or get in touch
      with us for help: :ref:`how-to-get-help`.

   2. Github method

      Additionally to the workflow described here, you can make the
      :ref:`changes directly on Github <docs-contribute-github-method>`.

      This workflow can be used for minor
      changes that do not involve much markup.

      Watch the official YouTube video `Tutorial - Contribute to
      docs.typo3.org <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNxO-aXY5Yw>`__
      to get started.

      .. important::

         Please note that some of the sphinx markup like *toctree* or
         *intersphinx* linking will not render correctly in the Github
         preview.

      For extensive changes, it is recommended to use the *git* / *docker*
      method.
