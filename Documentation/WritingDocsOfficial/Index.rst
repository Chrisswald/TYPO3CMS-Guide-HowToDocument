======================================
Contributing to official documentation
======================================

The community is welcome to make changes to the documentation.

If you need help, contact us in the **Slack** channel
**#typo3-documentation**. If you do not yet have a Slack account,
see :ref:`slack` for more information.

This chapter explains how to make changes to the official
documentation on `docs.typo3.org <https://docs.typo3.org>`__.

We will not repeat information in this chapter, that is already
explained elsewhere in this manual.

**Suggested reading order:**

Here is a suggestion how to
proceed (but depending on your experience and how you prefer to
work, you may want to jump to a specific section, read in a
different order or skip some sections and come back here later).

#. Get an introduction by looking a the :ref:`github-method-youtube`
#. Choose which workflow to use: :ref:`docs-official-workflow-methods`.
#. Do you already know what you want to do? If not, get inspiration:
   :ref:`docs-official-how-you-can-help`
#. To get a better understanding of the documentation and the conventions
   used, it can't hurt to look at :ref:`basic-principles`
#. Familiarize yourself with the language (reST and sphinx) by looking
   at the source of existing docs, reading
   :ref:`general-conventions` and the beginning of
   :ref:`Formatting-with-reST`.
#. Make your changes. Start small.



**Note about other documentation:**

Please note that some of the rendered documentation is
maintained elsewhere (e.g. Core Changelog). This chapter focuses on
making changes to the major manuals, maintained on `Github: TYPO3
Documentation <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation>`__, such
as:

* The `Tutorials and Guides <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/GuidesAndTutorials/Index.html>`__,
* The `Core documenation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/References/Index.html>`_
  (except for Changelog)_

Manuals, not maintained in the TYPO3-Documentation workspace on Github
must be edited elsewhere, see :ref:`overview-of-types`.
