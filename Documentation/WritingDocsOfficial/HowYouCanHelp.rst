How You Can Help
================


Everyone can contribute to the TYPO3 documentation and contributions are
very much appreciated.


.. important::
   These are just examples to get you started. You are not restricted to this,
   as a contributor. If you can make useful improvements, do it!
   The best contributions come from starting with something that bothers you
   the most.



Make Minor Changes
==================

If you see a typo, a broken link or can make some improvements in
the spelling, do not hesitate to click on "Edit me on Github" and make
the change yourself. See :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` for
a walkthrough.

.. _how-you-can-help-check-spelling:

Check Spelling
==============

Check spelling for consistency. For example, compare spelling of title
and headlines to `The TYPO3 Writing Style Guide
<https://typo3.org/community/teams/content/writing-style-guide/>`__ on typo3.org.

Is spelling of proper nouns correct?

See :ref:`content-styleguide` for more information, use the online tool
https://capitalizemytitle.com/ to check title spelling.


.. _how-you-can-help-fix-issues:

Fix Issues
==========

If you are a new contributor, you can look for issues in TYPO3-Documentation
with the label "good first issue":

* `"good first issue"
  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20archived%3Afalse%20user%3ATYPO3-Documentation+no%3Aassignee>`__
* ... or go to the `Issues tab in Github <https://github.com/issues>`__ and enter `is:open is:issue archived:false label:"good first issue" user:TYPO3-Documentation` in the search field (this should get you the same result) 


Using this link, you can get a list of all open, unassigned issues:

* `Open, unassigned issues 
  <https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2FT3DocTeam+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+no%3Aassignee>`__ (without Documentation Team issues, without t3SphinxThemeRtd, without t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs)

Pick an issue for a topic you are familiar with and try to fix it. Some of the
issues address a problem, some are enhancements where new text needs to be
written.

For more links to GitHub issues, see :ref:`links-github-issues`.


You can also look at the open issues of a manual you are familiar with, pick one
and fix the problem.

For example:

* `Issues for this guide "Writing Documentation"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/issues>`__
* `Issues for "Getting Started Tutorial"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-GettingStarted/issues>`__

To find the issues for a specific manual click on "Related links" (on the
bottom left of the page).

Replace Outdated Images
=======================

Replace outdated images, for example in the :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
reference.

Look at :ref:`how-to-document-images` for information about how to
embed images with reST.

Add YouTube Videos
==================

Add some new YouTube videos from the  `TYPO3 YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpl8LY9Tr3PB26Kk2FYW_w>`__.

See :ref:`youtube-videos` for information on how to do this.

Add Information from the ChangeLog
==================================

Find information in the `TYPO3 ChangeLog <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/>`__
that is not yet documented and add it to a manual where the information
is best documented, e.g.:

* :ref:`t3coreapi:start`
* :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
* :ref:`t3tca:start`
* :ref:`t3tsref:start`


Teach and Motivate Others
=========================

If you are already familiar with the workflow, you can help others
to get started. Whenever you are at a `TYPO3 event <https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__
(Sprint, Barcamp, etc.), on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typo3>`__ 
or in a `Slack <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__ channel and someone finds
something missing in the documentation, help them make the
necessary changes themselves.

Thank others for their contributions (e.g. on Slack or personally).

.. _contribute-what-social-media:

Spread the Word
===============

Tell others about things in the documentation, that are 
`new <https://docs.typo3.org/News/Index.html>`__
and that you find interesting. 

Remind people, that everyone can contribute!

* `Tweet <https://twitter.com/>`__
  (hashtag: `#TYPO3 <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TYPO3>`__). 
  Additionally, you can use `#T3Docs <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23T3Docs>`__,
  `#T3Contribute <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23T3Contribute>`__,
  #T3DC (for docs contribution)


.. _how-you-can-help-new-content:

Make Suggestions for New Content
================================

Sometimes you can directly add content in a manual or create an issue for it.

But, what if you are not sure, where the new content should go or if it should
be created at all?

If this is the case, either:

* Raise the question in the #typo3-documentation channel on Slack
* Or, add a comment with your suggestion to this general issue: 
  `What content is missing in the documentation? <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/T3DocTeam/issues/85>`__

.. _how-you-can-help-review-manuals:

Review Manuals
==============

Pick a manual (such as :ref:`t3start:start`, :ref:`t3coreapi:start`) and start reviewing it.
If you find something that needs fixing or something is missing, either fix it or write an
issue for it, if you cannot make the changes yourself.

Help to keep this list up to date: :ref:`t3docteam:overview-of-manuals-review`

   Blog About Your Contributions 
   =============================

   Telling a real life story may help others to make the decision to 
   contribute. It's your story, so you decide what's in it, but here
   are some ideas to get you started:

   * What gave you the motivation to contribute?
   * What advice can you give others?
