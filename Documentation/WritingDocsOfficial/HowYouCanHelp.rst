How You Can Help
================

Everyone can contribute to the TYPO3 documentation and contributions are
very much appreciated.

There are a number of things you can do to help.

.. important::
   These are just examples to get you started. You are not restricted to this,
   as a contributor. If you can make useful improvements, do it!



Make Minor Changes
==================

If you see a typo, a broken link or can make some improvements in
the spelling, do not hesitate to click on "Edit me on Github" and make
the change yourself. See :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` for
a walkthrough.

.. _how-you-can-help-check-spelling:

Check Spelling
==============

Check spelling for consistency. For example, compare spelling of title
and headlines to `The TYPO3 Writing Style Guide
<https://typo3.org/community/teams/content/writing-style-guide/>`__ on typo3.org.

Is spelling of proper nouns correct?

See :ref:`content-styleguide` for more information, use the online tool
https://capitalizemytitle.com/ to check title spelling.


.. _how-you-can-help-fix-issues:

Fix Issues
==========

If you are a new contributor, you can look for issues in TYPO3-Documentation
with the label "good first issue":

* `Open, unassigned issues with label "good first issue" in TYPO3-Documentation
  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20archived%3Afalse%20user%3ATYPO3-Documentation+no%3Aassignee>`__
* ... or go to the `Issues tab in Github <https://github.com/issues>`__ and enter `is:open is:issue archived:false label:"good first issue" user:TYPO3-Documentation` in the search field (this should get you the same result) 


Using this link, you can get a list of all open, unassigned issues:

* `Open, unassigned issues (without Documentation Team issues, without t3SphinxThemeRtd, without t3SphinxThemeRtdDemoDocs)
  <https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2FT3DocTeam+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+-repo%3ATYPO3-Documentation%2Ft3SphinxThemeRtd+no%3Aassignee>`__

Pick an issue for a topic you are familiar with and try to fix it. Some of the
issues address a problem, some are enhancements where new text needs to be
written.

For more links to GitHub issues, see :ref:`links-github-issues`.


You can also look at the open issues of a manual you are familiar with, pick one
and fix the problem.

For example:

* `Issues for this guide
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/issues>`__
* `Issues for "Getting Started"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-GettingStarted/issues>`__

To find the issues for a specific manual click on "Related links" (on the
bottom left of the page).

Replace Outdated Images
=======================

Replace outdated images, for example in the :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
reference.

Look at :ref:`how-to-document-images` for information about how to
embed images with reST.

Add YouTube Videos
==================

Add some new YouTube videos from the  `TYPO3 YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpl8LY9Tr3PB26Kk2FYW_w>`__.

See :ref:`youtube-videos` for information on how to do this.

Add Information from the ChangeLog
==================================

Find information in the `TYPO3 ChangeLog <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/latest/>`__
that is not yet documented and add it to a manual where the information
is best documented, e.g.:

* :ref:`t3coreapi:start`
* :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
* :ref:`t3tca:start`
* :ref:`t3tsref:start`


Teach and Motivate Others
=========================

If you are already familiar with the workflow, you can help others
to get started. Whenever you are at a `TYPO3 event <https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__
(Sprint, Barcamp, etc.), on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typo3>`__ 
or in a `Slack <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__ channel and someone finds
something missing in the documentation, help them make the
necessary changes themselves.

Thank others for their contributions (e.g. on Slack or personally).

Spread the Word
===============

`Tweet <https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23typo3>`__
(hashtag: #typo3) or blog about things in the documentation, that are 
`new <https://docs.typo3.org/News/Index.html>`__
and that you find interesting. Remind people, that everyone can contribute!


.. _how-you-can-help-review-manuals:

Review Manuals
==============

Pick a manual (such as :ref:`t3start:start`, :ref:`t3coreapi:start`) and start reviewing it.
If you find something that needs fixing or something is missing, either fix it or write an
issue for it, if you cannot make the changes yourself.

You can also give general feedback as issues, but if possible try to
outline some way in which the manual can be improved.

If you can, please try to fix the issue yourself.

Some general things to look out for:

* Does the manual contain spelling mistakes or language errors?
* Is the language clear and easy to follow?

Here are some things to look out for, while reviewing Tutorials:

* Does the manual contain clear, easy to follow steps with screenshots or code examples,
  where necessary?
* Is the information correct and up to date? 
* Is someone, who is new to the topic, capable of following the Tutorial?

More information: :ref:`t3docteam:whats-a-tutorial`

Here are some things to look out for, while reviewing Guides:

* Does it have a clear structure?
* Did you easily find the information you needed?
* For longer sections: Is there a summary available, as a "Quick Start" or "Quick Reference"
  (Example: :ref:`Logging Quick Start <t3coreapi:logging-quickstart>`)?
