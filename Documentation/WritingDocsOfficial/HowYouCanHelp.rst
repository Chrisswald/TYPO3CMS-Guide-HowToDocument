How You Can Help
================

Everyone can contribute to the TYPO3 documentation and contributions are
very much appreciated.

There are a number of things you can do to help.

.. important::
   These are just examples to get you started. You are not restricted to this,
   as a contributor. If you can make useful improvements, do it!



Make Minor Changes
==================

If you see a typo, a broken link or can make some improvements in
the spelling, do not hesitate to click on "Edit me on Github" and make
the change yourself. See :ref:`docs-contribute-github-method` for
a walkthrough.

.. _how-you-can-help-check-spelling:

Check Spelling
==============

Check spelling for consistency. Specifically, compare spelling of title
and headlines to `The TYPO3 Writing Style Guide
<https://typo3.org/community/teams/content/writing-style-guide/>`__ on typo3.org.

Is spelling of proper nouns correct?

See: :ref:`content-styleguide`


.. _how-you-can-help-fix-issues:

Fix Issues
==========

If you are a new contributor, you can look for issues in TYPO3-Documentation  with the label "good first issue":

* `open issues with label "good first issue" in TYPO3-Documentation
  <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20archived%3Afalse%20user%3ATYPO3-Documentation>`__
* ... or go to the `Issues tab in Github <https://github.com/issues>` and enter `is:open is:issue archived:false label:"good first issue" user:TYPO3-Documentation` in the search field (this should get you the same result) 


You can look at the open issues of a manual you are familiar with, pick one
and fix the problem.

For example:

* `Issues for this guide
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-HowToDocument/issues>`__
* `Issues for "Getting Started"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Tutorial-GettingStarted/issues>`__
* `Issues for "Installation and Upgrade Guide"
  <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/TYPO3CMS-Guide-Installation/issues>`__

To find the issues for a specific manual click on "Related links" (on the
bottom left of the page).

For advanced contributors:

* `all open issues in TYPO3-Documentation
  <https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=org%3ATYPO3-Documentation+type%3Aissue&s=updated&state=open&type=Issues>`__

Replace Outdated Images
=======================

Replace outdated images, for example in the :ref:`t3tsconfig:start`
reference.

Look at :ref:`how-to-document-images` for information about how to
use images.

Add YouTube Videos
==================

Add some new YouTube videos from the  `TYPO3 YouTube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwpl8LY9Tr3PB26Kk2FYW_w>`__.

See :ref:`youtube-videos` for information on how to do this.

Teach and Motivate Others
=========================

If you are already familiar with the workflow, you can help others
to get started. Whenever you are at a `TYPO3 event <https://typo3.org/community/events/>`__
(Sprint, Barcamp, etc.), on `StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/typo3>`__ 
or in a `Slack <https://my.typo3.org/index.php?id=35>`__ channel and someone finds
something missing in the documentation, help them make the
necessary changes themselves.

Thank others for their contributions (e.g. on Slack or personally).

Spread the Word
===============

`Tweet <https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23typo3>`__
(hashtag: #typo3) about things in the documentation, that are 
`new <https://docs.typo3.org/News/Index.html>`__
and that you find interesting. Remind people, that everyone can contribute!


.. _how-you-can-help-review-manuals:

Review Manuals
==============

Pick a manual (such as :ref:`t3start:start`, :ref:`t3coreapi:start`) and start reviewing it.
If you find something that needs fixing or something is missing, either fix it or write an
issue for it, if you cannot make the changes yourself.

You can also give general feedback as issues, but if possible try to
outline some way in which the manual can be improved.

If you can, please try to fix the issue yourself.

Some general things to look out for:

* Does the manual contain spelling mistakes or language errors?
* Is the language clear and easy to follow?

Here are some things to look out for, while reviewing Tutorials:

* Does the manual contain clear, easy to follow steps with screenshots or code examples,
  where necessary?
* Is the information correct and up to date? 
* Is someone, who is new to the topic, capable of following the Tutorial?

More information: :ref:`t3docteam:whats-a-tutorial`

Here are some things to look out for, while reviewing Guides:

* Does it have a clear structure?
* Did you easily find the information you needed?
* For longer sections: Is there a summary available, as a "Quick Start" or "Quick Reference"
  (Example: :ref:`Logging Quick Start <t3coreapi:logging-quickstart>`)?
