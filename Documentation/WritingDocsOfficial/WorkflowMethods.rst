============================
Overview of Workflow methods
============================

There are different workflow methods which you can use to make changes.
Use what you are most comfortable with!

   1. "Edit me on Github" workflow (which was used in the introduction
      of this chapter)

      You can edit documentation directly online in your browser.

      This workflow can be used for minor changes.

      For extensive changes, it is recommended to use "Local Editing
      and Rendering with Docker".

      **Get started:** :ref:`"Edit me on Github"
      <docs-contribute-github-method>`.

   2. "Local Editing and Rendering with Docker"

      If you are familiar with Git, Docker and the command line,
      you can use this workflow.

      **Get started:** :ref:`docs-contribute-git-docker`

We recommend to try out the "Edit me on Github" workflow, because it is
a way to quickly make changes, but use :ref:`"Local Editing and Rendering
with Docker" <docs-contribute-git-docker>` in the long run for larger
changes.
