============================
Overview of Workflow methods
============================

There is more than one way to do make changes to the
documentation. 


.. rst-class:: bignums

   1. git / docker method

      If you are familiar with git, docker and the command line,
      you can go straight to :ref:`docs-contribute-quickstart` to
      get started.

      If not, you can either use the Github method or get in touch
      with us for help: :ref:`how-to-get-help`.

   2. Github method

      Additionally to the workflow *git* / *docker* method, you can make the
      :ref:`changes directly on Github <docs-contribute-github-method>`.

      This workflow can be used for minor changes that do not involve much markup.

      .. important::

         Please note that some of the sphinx markup like *toctree* or
         *intersphinx* linking will not render correctly in the Github
         preview.

      For extensive changes, it is recommended to use the *git* / *docker*
      method.
