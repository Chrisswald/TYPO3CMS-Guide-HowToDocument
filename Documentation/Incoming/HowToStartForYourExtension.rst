How to start Documentation for Your TYPO3 Extension
===================================================

2016-12-29 by Martin Bless

**Quickstart:**

-  Get yourself one of the T3DocumentationStarter projects that look like
   https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/drafts/github/T3DocumentationStarter/Public-Info-000/

-  Read the frontpage of the starter to learn how it works.

-  You may edit directly at Github. Just do a little update and save (=push),
   and some very few minutes later you can reload the page and see what the
   server has rendered for you. You don't have to install or render anything yourself.
   The server will do that for you.

-  Or work with Github as you usually do.

-  To become the owner of a starter project send a mail with your **Github username**
   to the docteam to documentation@typo3.org and ask for a T3DocumentationStarter project.

-  Later: Copy the :file:`./Documentation` folder of the starter project to your extension.
   Write your documentation. Edit the metadata in :file:`./Documentation/Settings.cfg` and
   you are done.

Come to the sunny side of documentation - have fun!
