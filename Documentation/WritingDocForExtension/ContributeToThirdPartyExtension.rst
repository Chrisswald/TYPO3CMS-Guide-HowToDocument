Find the source
===============

First, you need to find out, where the source is maintained. Usually, this will
be a repository on Github. There, you can also check if documentation is already
available. It should be a `Documentation` folder or one of the alternatives
mentioned in :ref:`supported-filenames-and-formats`.


To find the source for a specific extension:

.. rst-class:: bignums

   1. Go to the `Extension repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/>`__

   2. In the search box, enter the name or extension key

   3. Select the extension

         :target: https://extensions.typo3.org/?L=0&id=1&tx_solr%5Bq%5D=news
         :class: with-shadow
         :width: 600px

   4. Click take a look in the code
