GitHub Issues
=============

To go to the Issue Board on GitHub for a manual you are reading online,
just click on :guilabel:`Related Links` on the bottom and then :guilabel:`Issues`.

But, you may want to get an overview for all open issues for TYPO3 documentation.
The repositories of the official manuals are all included in the organization
TYPO3-Documentation. Here are some links you can use to get a list of all issues:

For New Contributors
--------------------

* `Good first issues <https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20archived%3Afalse%20user%3ATYPO3-Documentation>`__

We added a label "Good first issue" which is used to tag issues that outline
a small task that may be good to good started. But, you are not restricted to
this! Start with any issue that seems to be a good fit for you!
