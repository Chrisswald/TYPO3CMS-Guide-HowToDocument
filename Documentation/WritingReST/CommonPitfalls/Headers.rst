Problems with headers
=====================


If you use section titles (headers), the underline must be **at least** as long as the text.

Though you can make the underlines longer than the text, common practice
througout the docs is to to keep it the same length.


Correct syntax
==============

::

   ================
   This is a header
   ================

   Another header
   ==============


   This is also correct but not recommended
   ======================================================


Wrong syntax
============


::

   Another header
   ------------
