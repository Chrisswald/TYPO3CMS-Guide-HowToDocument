Problems with Headers
=====================


If you use section titles (headers), the underline must be **at least** as long as the text.

Though you can make the underlines longer than the text, common practice
througout the docs is to to keep it the same length.


Correct Syntax
==============

::

   ================
   This is a Header
   ================

   Another Header
   ==============


   This Is Also Correct but Not Recommended
   ======================================================


Wrong Syntax
============


::

   Another header
   ------------
