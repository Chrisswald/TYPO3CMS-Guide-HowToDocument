How to write inline code
========================

Preferred: Use single backticks ` ... `
---------------------------------------

1. In general we are using `interpreted text roles`_ for small inline
   code snippets. Surround the code by *single backticks* and don't start or end
   the code with whitespace. Example: Type ```2 + 2 = 4``` to get `2 + 2 = 4`
   as result.

2. Just write the code as it is - don't escape or double anything.

3. Even better: Explicitely specify what kind of code (= textrole) it is. This better shows
   the semantics and in the output there may be a a special coloring or highlighting (on the way):

   (default)        ```result = (1 + x) * 32```                       `result = (1 + x) * 32`                      This works because in :file:`Includes.txt` we set the default role to ``:code:`...```

This includes labels from text-based interfaces such as those created using curses or other text-based libraries. Any label used in the interface should be marked with this role, including button labels, window titles, field names, menu and menu selection names, and even values in selection lists.
   kbd              ``Press :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`s```                  Press :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`s`                 Mark a sequence of keystrokes. What form the key sequence takes may depend on platform- or application-specific conventions. When there are no relevant conventions, the names of modifier keys should be spelled out, to improve accessibility for new users and non-native speakers. For example, an xemacs key sequence may be marked like :kbd:`C-x C-f`, but without reference to a specific application or platform, the same sequence should be marked as :kbd:`Control-x Control-f`.
   mailheader       ``:mailheader:`Content-Type```                    :mailheader:`Content-Type`                   The name of an RFC 822-style mail header. This markup does not imply that the header is being used in an email message, but can be used to refer to any header of the same “style.” This is also used for headers defined by the various MIME specifications. The header name should be entered in the same way it would normally be found in practice, with the camel-casing conventions being preferred where there is more than one common usage.

When to use literal code \`\`...``
----------------------------------

Things get tricky if your inline code already contains single backquotes (backticks).

4. In many cases you can still use the *interpreted textrole* as described in 1. to 3.
   For example we can write ``:code:`:html:`<br>```` to get :code:`:html:`<br>``

   This is possible if (a) your code doesn't start with a backtick and (b) if no backtick in
   your code has a trailing whitespace.

5. **But:** To be really free to include inline any code containing backticks you will want to use
   `inline literals`_. Again: Don't escape or double anything, whitespace is maintained.
   *Example:*

      Write

         .. code-block:: rst

            SQL-example code: ``SELECT  `tt_content` . `bodytext`  AS  `t1` . `text`;``

      to get:

         SQL-example code: ``SELECT  `tt_content` . `bodytext`  AS  `t1` . `text`;``

   **The drawbacks** of literal inline code notation are:

   -  there is no way to semantically classify the kind of code
   -  there is no special coloring or highlighting
   -  the raw reST code looks less beautiful and is less readable

'inline code' versus 'code-blocks'
==================================

The name for - very - small code snippets that occur within normal text flow
within sentences is *inline code*.

*inline code*

- is styled somewhat differently,
- has **no** syntax highlighting,
- does **not** need to be syntactically correct,
- can be compared to `<span>...</span>` tags in html,
- and is made up by self-defined names. For example, look at the :file:`../../Includes.txt`
  file to see how `:php:`, `:ts:` are defined.

In contrast, *code-blocks*

- appear "as a box",
- can have syntax highlighting,
- need to be syntactically correct in order to have highlighting,
- can be compared to `<pre>...</pre>` blocks in html,
- use predefined names for the different languages that come with Pygments,
  the syntax highlighter.


File Includes.txt
=================

This is the typical content of file :file:`./Documentation/Includes.txt`:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. This is 'Includes.txt'. It is included at the very top of each and
      every ReST source file in THIS documentation project (= manual).

   .. role:: aspect (emphasis)
   .. role:: html(code)
   .. role:: js(code)
   .. role:: php(code)
   .. role:: sep (strong)
   .. role:: yaml(code)
   .. role:: typoscript(code)

   .. role:: ts(typoscript)
      :class: typoscript

   .. default-role:: code
   .. highlight:: php
