=============================
Formatting with reST & Sphinx
=============================

This chapter is a reference for various kinds of markup.

It is recommended to read (or at least browse through)
the :ref:`writing-rest-introdction` and the general
:ref:`format-rest-cgl` first.

Also read :ref:`rest-common-pitfalls` in order to avoid common
mistakes with the syntax.

You don't need to read the entire chapter, just lookup
the section that is relevant for what you plan to do.

We won't be covering every reST and sphinx markup that is
available. For more information, see `Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx CheatSheet
<http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`__

.. tip::
   See the t3SphinxThemeRtd demo docs for more examples.
